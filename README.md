Hi! This is I-Cue, our team’s submission for StormHacks 2022, a studying aid that helps you improve recall.

One of the most impactful forms of studying is an increase in intensity. The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for diverse educational tools and strategies as the pandemic had a negative impact on student learning. Existing assistive technologies that test one’s recall are proven to increase the grade of 90% of students. Tools like Kahoot and Quizlet use multiple choice and flash cards to test your memory. What I-Cue does is use AI to examine the context of your answers to test understanding instead of rote memorization. I-Cue was inspired by what scientists have dubbed the protégé effect, where research has shown, is one of the best ways to facilitate your learning process.
